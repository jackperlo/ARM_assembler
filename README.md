# ARM Assembler
This repository contains a basic library of ARM Assembler and C code which helped me and my collegue Fabrizio Sanino to prepare for our Computer Architectures Exam done in 2023 at Politecnico di Torino.

## Landtiger NXP LPC1768
The code is written for the *Landtiger NXP LPC1768* used in Politecnico. <br/>
Meaningful informations about the chip composition:
    - **ARM 32-bit Cortex-M3** microcontroller with MPU, CPU clock up to 100MHz
    - 512kB on-chip Flash ROM
    - 4x 32-bit Timers and a Repetitive Interrupt Controller 
    - 64kB RAM, Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller
    - Power Management Unit and Wakeup Interrupt Controller
<br/>
The IDE used to develop this project is [*Keil uVision*](https://www2.keil.com/mdk5/uvision/).

## How is this Repository organized?
- ***Code_Snippets***, this directory contains several code snippets written in both C and ARM Assembler which were useful to improve ourselves in developing assembly code and which could have been used during the exam. (spoiler: they were not used!).
- ***Exam_Library***, this directory contains the code from which we both (me and Fabrizio) started during our exam. Since the development of a project like takes a couple of hours we were allowed to build a library of our own and start from it to develop the exam requirements.
- ***useful_notes***, this notes really helped us to manage the different scenarios which a project like this could have lead us to.
